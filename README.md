#THIS PROJECT IS NOT BEING CONTINUED
This project is currently on ice. Hoyoverse was rolling out their token_v2 across all endpoints. The token_v2 needs to be refreshed way more often and thus this whole bot is just kinda useless. You can still use the V1 token, but it will throw errors here and their and im sure it will be completely depricated soonTM.
